Track Name: Open Innovation

Problem Statement: The inspiration for EcoScan came from observing the common challenges people encounter when trying to recycle correctly. We aimed to create a solution that simplifies the recycling process, making it more accessible for everyone. With a deep appreciation for technology and programming, we decided to leverage AI to help solve this issue.

Introduction to problem statement and proposed solution:EcoScan leverages AI for image classification and integrates an AI chatbot (ChatGPT) to assist users in identifying the correct recycling method for different items. By scanning an object with their phone's camera, users receive immediate instructions on the appropriate recycling steps. Additionally, EcoScan includes a speech recognition feature, enabling users to interact with the AI using voice commands.
